# Resonate VL Workshop
we try to create a clone of Osmos in vvvv &amp; VL


Our game is made up outof 3 main game components:

* Control
* Game logic
* Display

All of these three components access the core document, where the control data and wolrd data types are defined. These are the "interfaces" between the mentioned game components.
